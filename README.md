This project will explore and utilize Python libraries to analyze data related to public library services, aiming to gain insights into library usage patterns, resource allocation, and potential areas for improvement. Specifically, it will leverage Python's capabilities in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization to understand how public libraries can better serve their communities. 
Public libraries play a vital role in communities, offering access to books, information, and educational resources. However, understanding how these resources are utilized and how to optimize their impact requires a deeper analysis of library service data.
